Grandtotem
===

The Grandtotem is a medium-fidelity asynchronous communication device designed to support the relationship between grandparents and their student grandchildren studying internationally.  It functions as a focal point for family ritual, a photo frame, and a relationship media album.

This repository contains the software implementation for the Grandtotem prototype.

Originally developed in the Embodied Computing course (with Prof. Lana Yarosh) at the University of Minnesota and submitted to the CHI 2019 Student Design Competition and to CSCW 2020.

    abstract = {The grandchild-grandparent relationship faces unique challenges among international students. We developed the Grandtotem, which functions as a focal point for family ritual, a photo frame, and a relationship media album. Research with international student grandchildren helped to identify three dimensions along which their relationships with grandparents must adapt: (1) technology, (2) physical barriers, and (3) changing roles. Initial design feedback suggests that the Grandtotem is a promising tool for strengthening the social fabric during a difficult time of cultural transition.},
